Each warrior has a high selection of items to choose from, as well as being able to play aggressively or defensively. Can upgrade into a Barbarian or Dragoon at level 30.",
        "Ranger: The Ranger's bows are their livelihood. Each of their attacks strike with true passion, and with an arsenal of skills, a ranger can be quite deadly. At level 30, a Ranger can become a Marksman or a Guard.",
        "Mage: A Mage's power comes from their magic and their mastery of special abilities! Most magic requires time to cast, but mages can lower this time, weaken enemies, and defend themselves so that the enemy won't even cause damage. At level 30, can become a Wizard or a Necromancer.",
        "Rogue: Capable of breaking through the toughest of defenses, a Rogue specializes in different abilities meant to do one thing: kill. Whether it be high impact damage, piercing, or damage over time, a rogue can specialize in any killing technique. Of course, such power means that a rogue won't be too defensive. Can upgrade into an Assassin or a Ninja at level 30.",

The bard shouldn't increase strength of magic, because his moves do not use such trivialities. A Bard isn't left without offense though. A Bard's song can cause his enemies' ears to bleed and death will come to those who oppose them... or even help them. At level 30, can upgrade to a poet or a Rocker.",

A monk has the ability to destroy enemy's mana with his fists, as well as cause enemies to become disoriented. Once a Monk becomes level 30, he can upgrade to a Scrapper or a Chi Master.",
